## Overview

EdgeLink is a [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) compatible run-time engine implemented in Rust<sub>†</sub>.

This program is designed to execute `flows.json` file that have been designed and exported/deployed using Node-RED, without any editor or other HTML/Web-related functionalities. The purpose of its development is to deploy tested Node-RED flows to devices with limited memory for execution.

Only the "function" node will use the lightweight QuickJS JS interpreter to run their code; all other functionalities are implemented in native Rust code.

## Features

![Memory Usage](assets/memory.png)

- **High Performance**: Leverage the advantages of the Rust language for excellent performance.
- **Low Memory Footprint**: Reduce memory usage compared to the NodeJS backend. Tests indicate that, for running a same simple workflow, the physical memory usage of EdgeLink is only 10% of that of Node-RED.
- **Scalability**: Retain the extensibility of Node-RED, supporting custom nodes.
- **Easy Migration**: Easily replace the existing Node-RED backend with minimal modifications.

## Quick Start

### 0. Install Node-RED

For the purpose of testing this project, we first need to install Node-RED as our flow designer and generate the `flows.json` file. Please refer to the Node-RED documentation for its installation and usage.

After completing the flow design in Node-RED, please ensure that you click the big red "Deploy" button to generate the `flows.json` file. By default, this file is located in `~/.node-red/flows.json`. Be mindful not to use Node-RED features that are not yet implemented in this project.

### 1. Build

```bash
cargo build -r
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Note for Windows Users:**
> Windows users should ensure that the `patch.exe` program is available in the `%PATH%` environment variable to successfully compile the project using `rquickjs`. This utility is required to apply patches to the QuickJS library for Windows compatibility. If Git is already installed, it will include `patch.exe`.
>
> To compile `rquickjs`, which is required by the project, you will need to install Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC) and the corresponding Windows Software Development Kit (SDK).

The toolchains tested are as follows(see GitHub Actions for details):

* `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`
* `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`
* `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`
* `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`
* `armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf`
* `armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabi`

### 2. Run

```bash
cargo run -r
```

Or:

```bash
./target/release/edgelinkd
```

By default, EdgeLink will read `~/.node-red/flows.json` and execute it.

You can use the `--help` command-line argument to view all the supported options for this program:

```bash
./target/release/edgelinkd --help
```

#### Run Unit Tests

```bash
cargo test --all
```

#### Run Integration Tests

Running integration tests requires first installing Python 3.9+ and the corresponding Pytest dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r ./tests/requirements.txt
```

Then execute the following command:

```bash
set PYO3_PYTHON=YOUR_PYTHON_EXECUTABLE_PATH # Windows only
cargo build --all
py.test
```

## Configuration

Adjust various settings in the configuration file, such as port number, `flows.json` path, etc. Refer to [CONFIG.md](docs/CONFIG.md) for more information.

## Project Status

**Pre-Alpha Stage**: The project is currently in the *pre-alpha* stage and cannot guarantee stable operation.

The heavy check mark ( :heavy_check_mark: ) below indicates that this feature has passed the integration test ported from Node-RED.

### Node-RED Features Roadmap:

- [x] :heavy_check_mark: Flow
- [x] :heavy_check_mark: Sub-flow
- [x] Group
- [x] :heavy_check_mark: Environment Variables
- [ ] Context
    - [x] Memory storage
    - [ ] Local file-system storage
- [ ] RED.util (WIP)
    - [x] `RED.util.cloneMessage()`
    - [x] `RED.util.generateId()`
- [x] Plug-in subsystem[^1]
- [ ] JSONata

[^1]: Rust's Tokio async functions cannot call into dynamic libraries, so currently, we can only use statically linked plugins. I will evaluate the possibility of adding plugins based on WebAssembly (WASM) or JavaScript (JS) in the future.

### The Current Status of Nodes:
